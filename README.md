# Unity Tips And Tricks

- alt + shift + right-click then move your mouse around in the editor scene view allows you to zoom in and out faster in the scene view.

- Although you can drag folders and place them into the Favorites section in the Project window, the folders you add there persist between projects and it is only useful to do this whole process if you are working on only one project. Do not click on the Favorites folders you have added when using other projects.

- In Unity 2018/2019, if your scene view prefab does not sync (this means that the position of the UI elements are in the wrong place) with the prefab view, make sure that the latest prefab is saved somewhere, then delete the prefab in the scene, and then replace it with the saved prefab.

- Under the UI system in Unity 2018/2019, try to avoid using layout groups. Use anchors instead. You can use layout groups first then delete them later, if you want to take advantage of layout groups.

- Use multiple canvases for your UIs instead of only one canvas.

- Canvas groups have an alpha option. You don't need to roll out your own.

- You can roll out your own health/energy bars quite easily without using UI sliders.

- There is a UI option to reset transforms.

- Animations can be renamed by double-clicking (I don't remember where). If you rename animations wrongly, it is a pain to rename all the links. Don't forget that Unity does not do linking/syncing for you yet with regards to animation names/animator.

- When I remember about any others, I'll add them here.
